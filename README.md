### Description
This is an idea I thought of while playing DnD with my friends on Discord. Gameplay was slowed down as we each searched through our character sheets for what dice and modifiers we had to roll for every check. So I thought having a bot store our character's information so we simply just had to input a simple command to perform whatever specific roll for a specified character.
Using Python and [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#)

### Implemented
- Character creation and storage

### Planned
- Saving throws for each stat
- Update command for stat changes and proficiencies
- Add attacks/weapons
