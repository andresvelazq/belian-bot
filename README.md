### Description
This is an idea I thought of while playing DnD with my friends on Discord. Gameplay was slowed down as we each searched through our character sheets for what dice and modifiers we had to roll for every check. So I thought having a bot store our character's information so we simply just had to input a simple command to perform whatever specific roll for a specified character.

Using Python and [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#)

### Implemented
- Character creation and storage
- Update saves
- Update stats
- Update skill proficiencies
- HP manipulation
- Saving throws for each stat
- Roll skill checks
- Custom dice roll
- Protect character from being modified by other players

### Planned
- Add attacks/weapons
- Show player the character stats
- Allow character creator to view stats
    - Allow DM to view character's stats
- Change storage to database instead of json files
